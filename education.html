<div class="debit">
    <h2>Debit</h2>
    <ul>
        <p>What`s a Debit?</p>
        <li>A debit is an accounting entry that results in either:</li>
        <ul style="list-style-type:square";>A decrease in liabilities on a company’s balance sheet.</ul>
    </ul>
    <p>In fundamental accounting, debits are balanced by credits, which operate in the exact opposite direction.
        A debit is an accounting entry that results in either an increase in assets or a decrease in liabilities on a company’s balance sheet.
    </p>
    <p>For instance, if a firm takes out a loan to purchase equipment, it would simultaneously debit fixed assets and credit a liabilities account, depending on the nature of the loan. The abbreviation for debit is sometimes “dr,” which is short for “debtor.”</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
          <b> Double-Entery Bookkeeping:</b>
          In double-entry bookkeeping, all debits are made on the left side of the ledger and must be offset with corresponding credits on the right side of the ledger
        </li>
        <li>When recording transactions, debits and credits ensure that the <b>financial equation remains balanced</b></li>
        <li><b>Natural Balances:</b>
            Assets and expenses have natural debit balances. Positive values for assets and expenses are debited, while negative balances are credited.
For example, when you receive $1,000 in cash, a journal entry includes a debit of $1,000 to the cash account because cash is increasing.
        </li>
        <li>Conversely, if you pay $500 in cash, the journal entry has a credit to the cash account because cash is being reduced.</li>
        <li><b>Dangling debit:</b>
            A dangling debit is a debit balance with no offsetting credit balance. It occurs when there’s a discrepancy in a company’s balance sheet or when a company purchases goodwill or services.
        </li>
    <li>For instance, if a bookstore sells $20,000 worth of books, it would debit its cash account $20,000 and credit its books or inventory account $20,000. This reflects an increase in cash and a corresponding decrease in books.</li>

</div>
 <div class="Debit-card">
    <h2>Debit Card</h2>
    <p>A debit card, also known as a bank card, is a plastic or metal card that allows you to make purchases both in-store and online. </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Function: A debit card lets you pay for goods and services directly from your checking account. Unlike a credit card, which allows you to borrow money, a debit card deducts funds directly from your account.

        </li>
        <li>Usage: When making a purchase, you can swipe, tap, or insert your debit card at the payment terminal, similar to using a credit card. Some places may require you to enter a PIN (Personal Identification Number) to verify your identity.</li>
        <li>Transaction Process: Once authorized by your bank, the money is immediately transferred from your checking account to the merchant. If your account has sufficient funds, the transaction proceeds smoothly. However, if there isn’t enough money, one of two things can happen:
            </li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                <b>Overdraft Protection:</b>
                If you have overdraft protection, your bank covers the difference between the transaction amount and your available balance. This allows the transaction to proceed even if your account doesn’t have sufficient funds.
                However, keep in mind that using overdraft protection usually incurs an overdraft fee.
            </ul>
          
            <li>
        <b>Insufficient Funds:</b>
        Without overdraft protection, if your account balance is insufficient, the transaction will be declined.
In this case, you won’t be able to complete the purchase until you deposit more funds into your account.
